Flashing Guide:

    1. I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BRICK YOUR PHONE (nor the things that happens to your house and/or car!)
    2. Copy BOTH the sediROM zip AND the sediROM md5 file to your Glide!!
    3. Boot into Recovery mode (Poweroff the device then Power on while holding Volume Down)
    4. Ensure that you use TWRP(!) and that the MD5 sum file is in the same directory as the sediROM zip! Only then TWRP will automatically check the MD5 !
    5. Flash the latest sediROM zip file
    6. Choose "Easy Installation" mode
    7. Answer the few questions and wait until the flashing finishes
    
    OPTIONAL: You can decide to change kernel, baseband etc before rebooting from AROMA.
    Simply choose the related option after the easy installation has finished.
    
    8. When finished reboot and wait until it has fully started up
    
    OPTIONAL: You can choose to NOT reboot here and restart the wizard again. That way you can install more apps or change the Kernel etc.
    To do so simply select to install the sediROM zip again after you finished the easy installation and instead of step 6 choose the "Modify" mode.
    Afterwards go on with step 7 to 13.

    9. The Android setup wizard should come up (if not Â­> flash once again !)
    10. Go through the wizard and reboot once again afterwards
